The scope of existing software solutions is ported to R and enhanced with previously unimplemented methods of significance testing in single groups (Lashley & Bond, 1997 ) and handling of missing values. The package requires only minimal knowledge of R, and results can be exported for subsequent analyses to other software packages. We demonstrate the use of TripleR with several didactic examples.}, number={2}, journal={Behavior Research Methods}, author={Schönbrodt, F. D. and Back, M. D. and Schmukle, S.
