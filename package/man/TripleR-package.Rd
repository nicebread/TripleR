\title{Triple R: A Package for Round-Robin Analyses Using R}
\description{
Social Relation Model (SRM) analyses for single or multiple round-robin groups are performed. These analyses are either based on one manifest variable, one latent construct measured by two manifest variables, two manifest variables and their bivariate relations, or bivariate relations between two latent constructs each measured by two manifest variables.
