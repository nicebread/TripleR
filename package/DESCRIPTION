Description: Social Relation Model (SRM) analyses for single or multiple
    round-robin groups are performed. These analyses are either based on one
    manifest variable, one latent construct measured by two manifest variables,
    two manifest variables and their bivariate relations, or two latent
    constructs each measured by two manifest variables. Within-group t-tests
    for variance components and covariances are provided for single groups. 
	For multiple groups two types of significance tests are provided:
    between-groups t-tests (as in SOREMO) and enhanced standard errors based on 
	Lashely and Bond (1997). Handling for missing values is provided.
